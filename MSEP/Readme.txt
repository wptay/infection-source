In matlab, use "Set Path" to include the library "matlab_bgl"
Then refer to sample.m for a sample run

List of functions:
MSEP: Multiple Sources Estimation and Partitioning algorithm
IP: Infection Partitioning algorithm
TSE: Two Source Estimation algorithm
spath: return shortest path between two nodes
passdown: downward process of the Tree Sizes and Products Computation algorithm
